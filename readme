# Overview
The project presents a basic framework demonstrating how to interface with the Interactive Brokers API and execute trading decisions as determined by a classifier.

# How it works
Future prices are binarily encoded (1 = price higher than prev time steps, 0 if not), given some threshold. For example, it is not useful for the model to know that a price change
from $1000.00 to $1000.01 is a 'price increase'. Depending on your time horizion, set your price change threshold accordingly. For hourly data, we used 0.05% change. Day-level data
should have higher threshold. 

The agent was trained on standard price data, volume, technical indicators and sentiment data, and makes buying decisions every time step (scheduler)
and sends off to IB to execute the trade. 

This iteration of the program is a buy-only model, but can be extended for multiclass and regression models to decide positions. Given some assumptions, a rudimentary 
backtesting process is carried out, examining what positions are held, for how long (until classication is opposite of original position entry (ie., Buy becomes Sell)) and 
last known price. Trading fees can also be incorporated into return.

# Performance
In backtesting, the agent barely broke even, and falling behind the 10% annual return benchmark. A live experimental trial was carried out with this agent and the results confirmed
the backtesting findings.

# Limitations
A severe caveat to be noted with this framework is that input data is not directly fed from IB to the model, but acquired through free third-party sources. In a productionized
environment, it is essential to use data from the platform from which you are executing your trades. 


# Next steps
The data quality, being free, was rather poor and offered no competitive edge. However, there is promise in working within the confines of medium-term data as opposed to 
long-term where macro effects dominate. Next steps is to encode regime change as a function of mean reversion tendency.
