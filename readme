# Overview
The project presents a basic framework demonstrating how to interface with the Interactive Brokers API and execute trading decisions as determined by a classifier.

This iteration of the program is a buy-only model, but can be extended for multiclass and regression models to decide positions. Given some assumptions, a rudimentary 
backtesting process is carried out, examining what positions are held, for how long (until classication is opposite of original position entry (ie., Buy becomes Sell)) and 
last known price. Trading fees can also be incorporated into return.

A severe caveat to be noted with this framework is that input data is not directly fed from IB to the model, but acquired through free third-party sources. In a productionized
environment, it is essential to use data from the platform from which you are executing your trades.
